Project Description 

Household plants enhance indoor environments by improving air quality, increasing humidity, and reducing stress. However, maintaining plant health, particularly watering, can be difficult for busy individuals. 

This project aims to develop an automated irrigation system for household plants, managed via a mobile app. The system will use sensors to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and light, ensuring plants are watered efficiently. Users can monitor their plants remotely and access a database of common household plants with their optimal growing conditions. The app will also allow users to adjust irrigation settings to suit the needs of specific plants. 

 

Why? 

Caring for plants requires quite a lot of attention, especially in watering and maintaining proper conditions. This is challenging for people with busy schedules. Traditional systems lack flexibility for different plant species' needs. By automating irrigation and integrating an app for user customization, this system offers a simple and effective solution. Users can remotely monitor and manage their plants, making care easier and more accessible.  

Parts Necessary 

The following components are required to develop the automated irrigation system: 

ESP32 Microcontroller: Controls sensors and actuators, provides Wi-Fi connectivity. 

Soil Moisture Sensors: Monitor soil moisture levels. 

Peristaltic Pump: Provides controlled water delivery. 

Water Reservoir: Stores the water supply. 

LCD Display: Displays system status. 

DHT11 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity. 

HC-SR04 Sensor: Monitors water levels in the reservoir. 

Mobile App: Monitors and adjusts system settings, provides plant information. 

Miscellaneous: Wiring, resistors, tubing, and power supply. 

 

Requirement Tailoring 

The system will cater to individual plant needs by allowing users to create plant profiles in the app. Users can set moisture and temperature for each plant type. The app will also come with optimal growing settings for common household plants, making it easy for users to input and manage data. The system will adjust its output based on these profiles, ensuring plants receive tailored care.
